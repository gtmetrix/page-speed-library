This directory contains a subset of the source code of ICU 4.4.2 for C/C++

1. It was obtained by downloading from: http://icu-project.org/download/4.4.html#ICU4C

2. Platform header files for Linux and Mac OS X:
   On Linux and Mac OS X, 'runConfigureICU Linux' and 'runConfigureICU MacOSX'
   are run to generate source/common/unicode/platform.h.
   Rename it to 'plinux.h' and 'pmac.h' on Linux and Mac and check them in.

   The Mac 'pmac.h' file needs to have patches/pmac.h.patch applied.

   Change source/common/unicode/umachine.h to refer to plinux.h and pmac.h
   on Linux and Mac, respetively.

3. Removed all unneeded source files.

4. source/common/utf_impl.c was modified to remove unneeded function
   implementations.

5. The header files were moved as shown below:
   source/common/unicode ==> public/common/unicode

 * "index of first 0-bit from msb" instruction and
 * one or two more integer instructions.
 *
 * For example, on an i386, do something like
 * - MOV AL, leadByte
 * - NOT AL         (8-bit, leave b15..b8==0..0, reverse only b7..b0)
 * - MOV AH, 0
 * - BSR BX, AX     (16-bit)
 * - MOV AX, 6      (result)
 * - JZ finish      (ZF==1 if leadByte==0xff)
 * - SUB AX, BX (result)
 * -finish:
 * (BSR: Bit Scan Reverse, scans for a 1-bit, starting from the MSB)
 *
 * In Unicode, all UTF-8 byte sequences with more than 4 bytes are illegal;
 * lead bytes above 0xf4 are illegal.
 * We keep them in this table for skipping long ISO 10646-UTF-8 sequences.

 * Handle the non-inline part of the U8_NEXT() macro and its obsolete sibling

 *
 * The "strict" parameter controls the error behavior:
 * <0  "Safe" behavior of U8_NEXT(): All illegal byte sequences yield a negative
 *     code point result.
 *  0  Obsolete "safe" behavior of UTF8_NEXT_CHAR_SAFE(..., FALSE):
 *     All illegal byte sequences yield a positive code point such that this
 *     result code point would be encoded with the same number of bytes as
 *     the illegal sequence.
 * >0  Obsolete "strict" behavior of UTF8_NEXT_CHAR_SAFE(..., TRUE):
 *     Same as the obsolete "safe" behavior, but non-characters are also treated
 *     like illegal sequences.
 *
 * The special negative (<0) value -2 is used for lenient treatment of surrogate
 * code points as legal. Some implementations use this for roundtripping of
 * Unicode 16-bit strings that are not well-formed UTF-16, that is, they
 * contain unpaired surrogates.
 *
 * Note that a UBool is the same as an int8_t.

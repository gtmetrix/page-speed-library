Description:
readpng is a "simple PNG display program". It expands PNGs into "raw"
(A)RGB image data.
readpng is only intended for use in unittests.

Local Modifications:
Ported readpng.h and readpng.c to a C++ class in the cpp subdirectory.
The C++ impl differs from the C impl in the following ways:
-images are read from memory istringstream instead of from disk (FILE*)
-a gamma "display exponent" is not applied to the image in the C++ version

This directory contains modified versions of googleurl files in order
to make googleurl compile and pass tests in our build environment.

Currently, only url_canon_unittest.cc is modified. This file has a few
tests that exercise character set encodings from character sets such
as big5, shift_jis, and gb2312. We only compile these tests if
ICU_NO_CONVERTER_DATA is not set, and we make sure to set this in our
version of googleurl.gyp.

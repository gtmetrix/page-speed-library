#. will be replaced with the width of the image, in pixels
#. (e.g. "320"); the $3 is a format token that will be replaced with
#. the height of the image, in pixels (e.g. "240"); the $4 is a format
#. token that will be replaced with the number of times this image

#. TRANSLATOR: The name of a Page Speed rule that tells users to try to
#. replace a group of small images on their site with a "CSS sprite" -- that
#. is, a single larger image containing a number of subimages, which can then
#. be used to display a single subimage at a time by using CSS to reveal a
#. different section of the large image in place of each of the original
#. small images.  This is displayed in a list of rule names that Page Speed
#. generates.

#. (that is, larger images containing a number of subimages, which can
#. then be used to display a single subimage at a time by using CSS to
#. reveal a different section of the large image in place of each of the

#. the URL of the page in which the small images appear.

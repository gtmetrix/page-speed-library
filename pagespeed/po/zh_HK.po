#  detected as being good candidates to be combined into CSS sprites
#  (that is, larger images containing a number of subimages, which can
#  then be used to display a single subimage at a time by using CSS to
#  reveal a different section of the large image in place of each of the
#  original small images).  It describes the problem to the user, and

#  transfer), and 3) the resource does not have a "Vary" HTTP header
#  whose value is set to "Accept-Encoding".  It describes the problem to

#  Header at the top of a list of URLs that Page Speed
#  detected as lacking a "cache validator" -- that is, an HTTP header
#  that indicates to the browser how to check whether a particular item
#  in its cache is still valid.  It describes the problem to the user,
#  and tells them how to fix it by configuring their server to include a
#  "Last-Modified" HTTP header, or an "ETag" HTTP header, either of which
#  can serve as a cache validator.  Note that "Last-Modified" and "ETag"
#  are code and should not be translated.

#  Descriptive header describing a list of CSS resources that
#  are all served from a single domain (in violation of the
#  CombineExternalResources rule).  It says how many resources were loaded
#  from that domain, gives the domain name itself, and is followed by a list
#  of the URLs of those resources.  It then tells the webmaster how to solve
#  the problem, by combining the resources into fewer files.  "$1" is a

#  This appears as a header before a list of URLs of resources
#  that use the JavaScript command "document.write" ("document.write" is

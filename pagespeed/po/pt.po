#  Header at the top of a list of URLs that Page Speed
#  detected as lacking a "cache validator" -- that is, an HTTP header
#  that indicates to the browser how to check whether a particular item
#  in its cache is still valid.  It describes the problem to the user,
#  and tells them how to fix it by configuring their server to include a

#  can serve as a cache validator.  Note that "Last-Modified" and "ETag"
#  are code and should not be translated.

#  Header at the top of a list of URLs that Page Speed

#  This appears as a header before a list of URLs of resources

#  downloading.  It describes the problem to the user and tells them
#  how to fix it by moving the inline script before the external CSS
#  URL, or after the next resource. The "$1" will be replace by the
#  URL of the HTML page.
msgid "The following inline script blocks were found in $1 between an external CSS file and another resource.  To allow parallel downloading, move the inline script before the external CSS file, or after the next resource."

#  Header at the top of a list of URLs of webpage resources
#  that Page Speed detected as having three properties: 1) they are
#  publicly cacheable (that is, they can be cached by HTTP proxies), 2)
#  they are compressible (that is, the data may be compressed during
#  transfer), and 3) the resource does not have a "Vary" HTTP header
#  whose value is set to "Accept-Encoding".  It describes the problem to
#  the user, and explains how to fix the problem by adding a Vary:
#  Accept-Encoding header to each of the listed resources.  Note that
#  "Vary: Accept-Encoding" is code and should not be translated.
msgid "The following publicly cacheable, compressible resources should have a \"Vary: Accept-Encoding\" header:"
msgstr "Les ressources compressibles suivantes, qui peuvent être mises en cache, doivent être associées à un en-tête \"Vary: Accept-Encoding\" :"

#  Header at the top of a list of URLs that Page Speed
#  detected as bad requests (requesting them returned HTTP codes 404 or
#  410).  It describes the problem to the user, and tells them how to fix
#  it by eliminating the bad requests.
msgid "The following requests are returning 404/410 responses.  Either fix the broken links, or remove the references to the non-existent resources."
msgstr "Les requêtes suivantes renvoient des réponses de type erreur 404/410. Réparez les liens brisés ou supprimez les références aux ressources inexistantes."

#  Header at the top of a list of URLs that Page Speed
#  detected as loaded synchronously. It describes the problem and tells
#  the user how to fix by loading them asynchronously.
msgid "The following resources are loaded synchronously. Load them asynchronously to reduce blocking of page rendering."
msgstr "Les ressources suivantes sont chargées de manière synchrone. Chargez-les de manière asynchrone afin de limiter le blocage de l'affichage des pages."

#  Header at the top of a list of URLs that Page Speed
#  detected as lacking a "cache validator" -- that is, an HTTP header
#  that indicates to the browser how to check whether a particular item
#  in its cache is still valid.  It describes the problem to the user,
#  and tells them how to fix it by configuring their server to include a
#  "Last-Modified" HTTP header, or an "ETag" HTTP header, either of which
#  can serve as a cache validator.  Note that "Last-Modified" and "ETag"
#  are code and should not be translated.
msgid "The following resources are missing a cache validator. Resources that do not specify a cache validator cannot be refreshed efficiently. Specify a Last-Modified or ETag header to enable cache validation for the following resources:"
msgstr "Les ressources suivantes ne sont associées à aucune technique de mise en cache et ne peuvent donc pas être actualisées efficacement. Spécifiez un en-tête Last-Modified ou ETag afin d'activer la validation du cache pour les ressources suivantes :"

#  Header at the top of a list of URLs that Page Speed
#  detected as being identical yet served multiple times from different
#  URLs.  It describes the problem to the user, and tells them how to
#  fix it by serving all these resources from the same URL.  The "$1"
#  is a format string that will be replaced with the number of requests
#  that could be saved (e.g. "3"); the "$2" is a format string that
#  will be replaced with the number of bytes that could be saved
#  (e.g. "12.3kB").
msgid "The following resources have identical contents, but are served from different URLs.  Serve these resources from a consistent URL to save $1 request(s) and $2."
msgstr "Les ressources suivantes présentent un contenu identique, mais sont diffusées à partir d'URL différentes. Diffusez-les à partir d'une seule URL afin d'économiser $1 requête(s) et de libérer $2."

#  Header at the top of a list of URLs that Page Speed
#  detected as either not declaring the character set (e.g. UTF-8,
#  Latin-1, or some other text encoding) being used, or declaring a
#  character set but doing so late in the page for a character set other
#  than what the browser was previously assuming.  It describes the
#  problem to the user, and tells them how to fix it by explicitly
#  specifying the character set near the beginning of the page.
msgid "The following resources have no character set specified or have a non-default character set specified late in the document. Specifying a character set early in these documents can speed up browser rendering."
msgstr "Les ressources suivantes ne sont associées à aucun jeu de caractères ou un jeu de caractères autre que celui par défaut est spécifié à la fin du document. Si vous indiquez un jeu de caractères en début de document, vous pouvez accélérer l'affichage des pages dans le navigateur."

#  Heading that explains why the URLs that follow
#  should be moved to different hostnames. "DNS" should remain
#  in the translated format string.
msgid "The hostnames of the following urls only serve one resource each. Avoid the extra DNS lookups by serving these resources from existing hostnames."
msgstr "Une seule ressource est diffusée à partir de chacun des noms d'hôte des URL suivantes. Diffusez ces ressources à partir de noms d'hôte existants afin d'éviter toute résolution DNS superflue."

#  Header at the top of a list of URLs that Page Speed
#  detected as having large requests. It describes the problem to the
#  user, and tells them how to fix it by reducing the size of requests.
msgid "The requests for the following URLs don't fit in a single packet.  Reducing the size of these requests could reduce latency."
msgstr "Les requêtes associées aux URL suivantes ne peuvent pas être incluses dans un seul et même paquet. Si vous réduisez la taille de ces requêtes, vous pourriez améliorer la réactivité de votre site."

#  Descriptive header describing a list of CSS resources that
#  are all served from a single domain (in violation of the
#  CombineExternalResources rule).  It says how many resources were loaded
#  from that domain, gives the domain name itself, and is followed by a list
#  of the URLs of those resources.  It then tells the webmaster how to solve
#  the problem, by combining the resources into fewer files.  "$1" is a
#  format token that will be replaced with the number of CSS files loaded
#  from the given domain. "$2" will be replaced by the domain name from
#  which all the CSS files were loaded.

#  Header at the top of a list of URLs that Page Speed
#  detected as from one host. It describes the problem to the user,

#  This appears as a header before a list of URLs of resources
#  that use the JavaScript command "document.write" ("document.write" is
#  code, and should not be translated).  It describes how using
#  "document.write" can slow down your website (by forcing external
#  resources to load serially, not in parallel).
msgid "Using document.write to fetch external resources can introduce serialization delays in the rendering of the page. The following resources use document.write to fetch external resources:"
